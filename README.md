**Announcements**

This text was added in the 1000th commit 

**[ANNOUNCEMENT|Quantum64]**
All developers should read the tutorial for developing on the new multilingual string system here:  https://github.com/SurvivalGamesDevTeam/TheSurvivalGames/blob/master/I18N_TUTORIAL.md

**[ANNOUNCEMENT|AgentTroll]**
Format is important: All classes should be based off of the Help SubCommand class with the titling comment and comments for each method. All indentations should be SPACES, not tabs. They should be 4 spaces, not 8 as well. **ALL CODE MUST BE IN JAVA 7**

**[ANNOUNCEMENT|Quantum64]**
Let's not use .*; for imports. If you're using eclipse, just Ctrl + Shift + o and it will auto clean up all your imports.

**[ANNOUNCEMENT|AgentTroll]**
Never use tabs.
